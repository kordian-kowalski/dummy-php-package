# dummy-php-package
This is a dummy PHP package that can be installed with composer.

It was built to have a lightweight dependency that would allow testing an automated build of a PHP app and autoloading of vendor files.

It contains a single `DummyClass` class that you can use in your code to confirm that all went well.
